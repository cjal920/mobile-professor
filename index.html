  <h3>MEET THE MOBILE PROFESSOR</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    
    <br>

    I’m Ellen Bluestone, the Mobile Professor—a supportive, experienced, one-of-a-kind professor with a digital platform that allows me to serve your academic needs without the constraints of institutional affiliation.
        
    As the Mobile Professor, I offer you the guidance, support, knowledge, and skill-building I’ve been offering students in college classes for 30+ years, but on an individualized basis, tailored to your precise needs—along with a mix of humor, excitement, and dynamism that’s rarely found in higher education.  
    
    In my many years of teaching, I’ve developed an uncanny ability to read students, as well as their papers, and to figure out what they need and how to provide it as quickly, thoroughly, and effectively as possible. 
    
    I’ve taught English at community colleges, colleges, and universities, and interacted with students of all ages, cultures, and economic backgrounds. 
    <br><br>
    I taught literature surveys and a range of other literature classes to undergraduates, using a self-styled method that empowered students to write truly inspired critical essays. 
    I taught research writing to undergraduates, letting students spread their wings and investigate topics of all types. 
    I designed and taught special courses in Women’s Studies that incorporated literature, the humanities, and art history. 
    I worked one-on-one with students in both a university writing center and learning center. 
    I spent seven years teaching graduate English online, covering the gamut of courses in British and American eras and topics, literary theory, gender studies, writing instruction, and the capstone.
    I won student-driven teaching awards at two major universities.
    <br><br>
    
    In addition to teaching English in college, I’ve taught English as a Second Language (ESL) both in language schools and on a private basis.
    <br><br>
    I have been teaching ESL via Skype for many years.
    I’ve also taught ESL to non-native speakers in corporations in the U.S. and abroad. 
    <br><br>
    
    I’ve taught writing in every conceivable context, both academically and professionally, and  have done an extensive amount of writing for individual companies.
    <br>
    I can teach any kind of writing to anyone who wants to learn.
    I can help writers at all levels of proficiency.
    <br>
    
    For many years, I’ve been working as both a private educational consultant and a university professor.  But recently, I’ve noticed that more of my private clients are students searching for good teaching—the kind they can’t always find in the places where they study—than business people searching for good writing. 
    <br><br>
    Many are looking for help with their coursework, writing assignments, literature reviews, theses, and dissertations.
    Others are looking for help with personal statements for admission to academic programs, internships, and residencies.
    Still others want to make up for deficiencies in their education and want to learn how to think and write at a higher level.
    These are the clients I most want to serve, as I am truly dedicated to education, and I see a great need for the kind of teaching I offer.
    <br><br>
    
    
    While tutoring services abound and university writing centers are available for cursory reviews of student papers, strong supplemental college-level instruction is hard to find—
    <br><br>
    Until now, that is—enter the Mobile Professor!!
    By consolidating my work as professor and consultant, I’m in a position to help students who might otherwise fall through the cracks. 
    By operating as a free agent, I can teach freely, without having to worry about institutional politics, interference or busywork.
    <br><br>
    As the Mobile Professor, I’m accountable to no one but you. 
    <br><br>
    I don’t have stacks of real or virtual papers to grade, so I can concentrate on you and your work. 
    I’m a free agent, so I don’t have to dim my academic passion to serve as a bland and replaceable purveyor of information.
    <br><br>
    By the same token, you can count on me for the kind of engaged and personalized teaching that you can’t always find at school, at a price that is considerably lower than tuition credits. And you can relax, knowing that I will never judge you or grade you down for needing help or admitting weakness.
    <br><br>
    I’m here to teach, mentor, and inspire you in a very special way. I’m here to help you find your own voice, develop your originality and creativity, and achieve your own success. I’m here to help you find satisfaction, delight, and confidence in your studies.
    <br><br>
    I won’t do your academic work for you, but I will give you whatever you need to truly succeed.

    <br><br><br>
    
    THE MOBILE PROFESSOR IS
    <br><br>
    A professor-in-the wings who works backstage to ensure your best possible performance
    <br><br>
    A dedicated educator who will focus on you, how you learn, and what you learn
    <br><br>
    An original thinker who will open your mind and challenge your ways of thinking
    <br><br>
    A cheerleader who will help you navigate coursework, academic deadlines, and life 
    <br><br>
    An advisor who will stay abreast of your work and research, helping you move forward
    <br><br>
    
    A motivator who will find ways to keep your skills and confidence level growing
    <br><br>
    
    A trainer who will continually seek out strategies to keep learning from getting stale
    <br><br>
    
    A mentor who will remain within your reach long after your current work is done
    <br><br>
    
    A writing coach who will teach you to say exactly what you want to say, in your own voice
    <br><br>
    
    An subject matter expert in Literature, Women’s Studies, and Art History

ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS

<br><br>

I have the rare distinction of being both a traditionally-trained scholar and an academic upstart.
<br><br>
I attended Nova High School in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida in its heyday as an experimental school. At Nova, I was trained to think, to explore, and to speak up. I followed that up with a four-year stint at  Wellesley College, a women’s college steeped in the rigor and traditions of the Seven Sisters, where I earned a B.A. with a major in Art History. From there, I studied the Philosophy and Appreciation of Art for three years at the Barnes Foundation, a unique educational institution and art museum. I then went on to do graduate studies in English at Villanova University and Rutgers University. While teaching at West Chester University, I trained as a fellow of the National Writing Project and the Pennsylvania Literature Project.

      <h4>CAPSTONE</h4>
      <p>
        Professor Ellen went above and beyond to help me with this capstone project. She answered every email (sometimes multiples during the day) to respond to any questions or issues that I had. Her grading and notes were thorough and very helpful in providing me with feedback that allowed my writing to continue to excel throughout the capstone process. I couldn’t have asked for a better professor.

        Professor Ellen did an exceptional job of presenting, explaining, and reinforcing all the elements of the course. In particular, her responses to comments in the discussion board were always insightful as she asked further probing questions that always kick-started deeper thoughts. Her feedback on assignments (for example, journals and papers) were more detailed than I have experienced before, reinforcing that she read and valued every idea and provided suggestions for improvement and deeper reflection when needed. Her approach is one of grace and interest in every student’s contribution. Really an outstanding educator!

    <h4>VICTORIAN LITERATURE CLASS</h4>
    <p>
      Prof. Ellen was the whole enchilada – she is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Victorian Lit. She pushed us to go deeper into the material and squeeze as much as possible out of each module. She clearly spent a lot of time editing, evaluating, and commenting on our work. Her comments on my papers were targeted and her directions for changes were very helpful. Her edits were thorough and well-supported. She takes the topic very seriously and I respect her for her commitment.

      <h4>VICTORIAN LITERATURE CLASS</h4>
      <p>
        Prof. Ellen was the whole enchilada – she is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Victorian Lit. She pushed us to go deeper into the material and squeeze as much as possible out of each module. She clearly spent a lot of time editing, evaluating, and commenting on our work. Her comments on my papers were targeted and her directions for changes were very helpful. Her edits were thorough and well-supported. She takes the topic very seriously and I respect her for her commitment.  </p>

      Dr. Bluestone gives very encouraging feedback and is also very clear about what she expects of her class.

        Professor Bluestone was very knowledgeable and ready to help with or further explain everything we did in class. Her comments on our blog posts were some of the most in depth I’ve gotten from any professor and I thought her response posts that asked questions about our blog posts were very helpful. I also found her comments on everything I turned in to be very insightful and again some of the longest and most in depth I’ve received. I don’t think there was anything I would want her to do differently.

          Professor Ellen did an exceptional job of presenting, explaining, and reinforcing all the elements of the course. In particular, her responses to comments in the discussion board were always insightful as she asked further probing questions that always kick-started deeper thoughts. Her feedback on assignments (for example, journals and papers) were more detailed than I have experienced before, reinforcing that she read and valued every idea and provided suggestions for improvement and deeper reflection when needed. Her approach is one of grace and interest in every student’s contribution. Really an outstanding educator!</p>

      I actually had the pleasure of talking to her by phone. She really does all she can to understand each student’s particular situation. She was very accommodating and knowledgeable.

        Dr. Bluestone set the tone for excellence and she would not allow anything less. She knew what we were all capable of doing and she didn’t want us to ever be discouraged. Even on the toughest days as a student, she always encouraged me to reach out to her and talk it out with her on what I was lacking. She took what I had to offer, modified it and it evolved into a great life lesson. Things do take time, but also it is going into each assignment confident, not basing the grade before to determine it was going to be the same this time. I welcomed the challenges and I am lucky there are Professors like her that do not allow her students to ever fall into the dark holes and not be able to find a light to get back out. She’s the light.
