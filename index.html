  <h3>MEET THE MOBILE PROFESSOR</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    
    <br>

    I’m Ellen Bluestone, the Mobile Professor—a supportive, experienced, one-of-a-kind professor with a digital platform that allows me to serve your academic needs without the constraints of institutional affiliation.
        
    As the Mobile Professor, I offer you the guidance, support, knowledge, and skill-building I’ve been offering students in college classes for 30+ years, but on an individualized basis, tailored to your precise needs—along with a mix of humor, excitement, and dynamism that’s rarely found in higher education.  
    
    In my many years of teaching, I’ve developed an uncanny ability to read students, as well as their papers, and to figure out what they need and how to provide it as quickly, thoroughly, and effectively as possible. 
    
    I’ve taught English at community colleges, colleges, and universities, and interacted with students of all ages, cultures, and economic backgrounds. 
    <br><br>
    I taught literature surveys and a range of other literature classes to undergraduates, using a self-styled method that empowered students to write truly inspired critical essays. 
    I taught research writing to undergraduates, letting students spread their wings and investigate topics of all types. 
    I designed and taught special courses in Women’s Studies that incorporated literature, the humanities, and art history. 
    I worked one-on-one with students in both a university writing center and learning center. 
    I spent seven years teaching graduate English online, covering the gamut of courses in British and American eras and topics, literary theory, gender studies, writing instruction, and the capstone.
    I won student-driven teaching awards at two major universities.
    <br><br>
    
    In addition to teaching English in college, I’ve taught English as a Second Language (ESL) both in language schools and on a private basis.
    <br><br>
    I have been teaching ESL via Skype for many years.
    I’ve also taught ESL to non-native speakers in corporations in the U.S. and abroad. 
    <br><br>
    
    I’ve taught writing in every conceivable context, both academically and professionally, and  have done an extensive amount of writing for individual companies.
    <br>
    I can teach any kind of writing to anyone who wants to learn.
    I can help writers at all levels of proficiency.
    <br>
    
    For many years, I’ve been working as both a private educational consultant and a university professor.  But recently, I’ve noticed that more of my private clients are students searching for good teaching—the kind they can’t always find in the places where they study—than business people searching for good writing. 
    <br><br>
    Many are looking for help with their coursework, writing assignments, literature reviews, theses, and dissertations.
    Others are looking for help with personal statements for admission to academic programs, internships, and residencies.
    Still others want to make up for deficiencies in their education and want to learn how to think and write at a higher level.
    These are the clients I most want to serve, as I am truly dedicated to education, and I see a great need for the kind of teaching I offer.
    <br><br>
    
    
    While tutoring services abound and university writing centers are available for cursory reviews of student papers, strong supplemental college-level instruction is hard to find—
    <br><br>
    Until now, that is—enter the Mobile Professor!!
    By consolidating my work as professor and consultant, I’m in a position to help students who might otherwise fall through the cracks. 
    By operating as a free agent, I can teach freely, without having to worry about institutional politics, interference or busywork.
    <br><br>
    As the Mobile Professor, I’m accountable to no one but you. 
    <br><br>
    I don’t have stacks of real or virtual papers to grade, so I can concentrate on you and your work. 
    I’m a free agent, so I don’t have to dim my academic passion to serve as a bland and replaceable purveyor of information.
    <br><br>
    By the same token, you can count on me for the kind of engaged and personalized teaching that you can’t always find at school, at a price that is considerably lower than tuition credits. And you can relax, knowing that I will never judge you or grade you down for needing help or admitting weakness.
    <br><br>
    I’m here to teach, mentor, and inspire you in a very special way. I’m here to help you find your own voice, develop your originality and creativity, and achieve your own success. I’m here to help you find satisfaction, delight, and confidence in your studies.
    <br><br>
    I won’t do your academic work for you, but I will give you whatever you need to truly succeed.

    <br><br><br>
    
    THE MOBILE PROFESSOR IS
    <br><br>
    A professor-in-the wings who works backstage to ensure your best possible performance
    <br><br>
    A dedicated educator who will focus on you, how you learn, and what you learn
    <br><br>
    An original thinker who will open your mind and challenge your ways of thinking
    <br><br>
    A cheerleader who will help you navigate coursework, academic deadlines, and life 
    <br><br>
    An advisor who will stay abreast of your work and research, helping you move forward
    <br><br>
    
    A motivator who will find ways to keep your skills and confidence level growing
    <br><br>
    
    A trainer who will continually seek out strategies to keep learning from getting stale
    <br><br>
    
    A mentor who will remain within your reach long after your current work is done
    <br><br>
    
    A writing coach who will teach you to say exactly what you want to say, in your own voice
    <br><br>
    
    An subject matter expert in Literature, Women’s Studies, and Art History

ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS

<br><br>

I have the rare distinction of being both a traditionally-trained scholar and an academic upstart.
<br><br>
I attended Nova High School in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida in its heyday as an experimental school. At Nova, I was trained to think, to explore, and to speak up. I followed that up with a four-year stint at  Wellesley College, a women’s college steeped in the rigor and traditions of the Seven Sisters, where I earned a B.A. with a major in Art History. From there, I studied the Philosophy and Appreciation of Art for three years at the Barnes Foundation, a unique educational institution and art museum. I then went on to do graduate studies in English at Villanova University and Rutgers University. While teaching at West Chester University, I trained as a fellow of the National Writing Project and the Pennsylvania Literature Project.

              "Ellen was an outstanding tutor, who was very positive. She was always there for me when I needed her and tutored me on a business writing course throughout my college life. 
              By end of semester, I was able to learn so much from her and gained my confidence, that I’m still applying in real life till this day.  
              I would recommend The Mobile Professor to anyone who needs help.""   </p>

            <p>"I am extremely pleased with the progress that Ellen and I have made with my writing over the course of my university studies. 
              With her help, I was able to earn an A in my Honors Analytical Writing course, and I finished at the top of my class. 
              As someone from a science background who always suffered from writer's block when it came to English papers, 
              I was both astonished and proud of the advances I had made with my writing skills. 
              When I later applied to graduate school, we also worked together to craft a fantastic personal statement. 
              I would highly recommend Ellen to anyone that is seeking help with writing."</p>

              After working with Ellen the first time on a personal statement, 
              I knew I could not trust anyone else with such a vital project. 
              Not only did Ellen help unlock my creative potential, 
              she also served as a mentor, spiritual guide, and friend. 
              Through her nonjudgmental and nurturing approach, we were able, 
              together, to create a personal statement that eloquently explored the truth I was yearning to access. 
              Without Ellen’s guidance, I would certainly not have succeeded on doing so alone.

              She has a special way of making her students feel extemely confident, enthusiastic about the material and imparts knowledge like no other. 
              She is encouraging, exceptionally intelligent on a wide variety of subject matters and best of all, she encourages her students not only to think but to develop the ability to think critically. 
              She is extremely passionate about teaching and her proudest moments usually pivots around seeing her students succeed. I am proud to have had Ellen as my tutor, and I am more than happy to recommend her to any student in search of an enthusiastic tutor."

              Ellen made herself readily available and focused a lot of her time and energy in challenging and pushing myself to think and write better. 
              I received a B in a graduate level writing course where I never cracked higher than C+ in any English course and that was only within 7 weeks of working with Ellen. 
              I couldn’t think of a better person or more qualified teacher to help anyone with their writing."
